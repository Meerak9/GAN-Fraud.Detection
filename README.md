# GAN Fraud Detection Project

This project explores the use of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to address the issue of **imbalanced datasets**, particularly in the context of **credit card fraud detection**.

The goal was to generate synthetic fraud samples using two GAN models:
- **Vanilla GAN**
- **Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)**

These generated samples were then used to balance the dataset and improve the performance of a classification model (Random Forest).


## Problem Statement

In many real-life applications, datasets are highly imbalanced â€” meaning one class is overrepresented while the other is rare. This leads to poor performance on the minority class, which is often the most important one to detect (e.g., fraud cases).

This project addresses this issue by generating synthetic fraud data using GANs to balance the dataset and improve classification accuracy.


## Dataset Description

- **Dataset**: Credit Card Fraud Detection (from Kaggle)
- **Total Transactions**: 284,807
- **Fraud Cases (Class = 1)**: 492 (0.17%)
- **Non-Fraud Cases (Class = 0)**: 284,315 (99.83%)

Clearly, the dataset is **highly imbalanced**, making it difficult for machine learning models to detect fraud effectively.


## Implemented Models

### 1. Vanilla GAN
- Generator + Discriminator architecture
- Trained for 100 epochs
- Generated 500 synthetic fraud samples

### 2. Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
- Uses a Critic instead of Discriminator
- More stable training with weight clipping
- Trained for 200 epochs
- Generated 500 synthetic fraud samples

## Classification Results

| Metric      | Original | Vanilla GAN | WGAN     |
|-------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| Precision   | 0.946    | 0.9995      | 0.9781   |
| Recall      | 0.833    | 0.9976      | 0.9436   |
| F1-Score    | 0.886    | 0.9985      | 0.9605   |
| ROC-AUC     | 0.963    | 0.9993      | 0.9781   |

Results show that both GAN models improved classification performance significantly, with **WGAN** offering better stability and realistic sample generation.


## Requirements

To run the code, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

##Notes

This project demonstrates how GANs can be used not only for image generation but also for improving machine learning models by generating realistic synthetic samples for underrepresented classes.
